# PortSwigger SQL Injection Labs

This repository documents my hands-on learning process in web application security, focused on SQL Injection vulnerabilities using the PortSwigger Web Security Academy.

Rather than simply completing labs, I document each vulnerability as it would be reported in a real-world penetration testing scenario.

---

## What you will find in this repository

- UNION-based SQL injection techniques
- Database enumeration on non-Oracle and Oracle databases
- Blind SQL injection using conditional responses
- Authentication bypass and data exfiltration
- Realistic attack methodology using Burp Suite

Each lab includes:
- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Exact payloads used
- Technical impact
- Risk and mitigation

---

## Why this repository

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in offensive web security by:
- Understanding how vulnerabilities work internally
- Learning to adapt techniques based on application behavior
- Developing professional documentation skills

This repository reflects my progression from basic SQL injection to advanced blind SQL injection techniques.

## Labs Completed

- SQL injection WHERE clause bypass
- SQL injection login bypass
- UNION-based column enumeration
- UNION-based data extraction
- Retrieving multiple values in a single column
- Database enumeration (non-Oracle)
- Database enumeration (Oracle)
- Blind SQL injection with conditional responses

More labs will be added as I continue advancing.

## Tools Used

- Burp Suite
- Manual SQL payload crafting
- Behavioral analysis for blind SQL injection
